## My Java solutions for various Katas in Codewars
I have listed my solutions in the appropriate folders. Feel free to browse!
Each Java file contains the Kata name and link.
I have included folders for each kyu level.
The katas are run in the Main Class. 
The directory is as such:
<pre>
codewars-java/
├── kyu6/
│   ├── KataA.java
│   ├── KataB.java
│   └── ...
├── kyu7/
│   ├── KataC.java
│   └── ...
├── ... 
│
└── Main.java
